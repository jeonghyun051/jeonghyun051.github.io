Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `Jekyll`, and `Bundler`. In addition, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is also required to be installed.

### Creating a New Site

There are two ways to create a new repository for this theme:

- [**Using the Chirpy Starter**](#option-1-using-the-chirpy-starter) - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing.
- [**Forking on GitHub**](#option-2-forking-on-github) - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.

#### Option 1. Using the Chirpy Starter

Create a new repository from the [**Chirpy Starter**][use-starter] and name it `<GH_USERNAME>.github.io`, where `GH_USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

#### Option 2. Forking on GitHub

[Fork **Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/fork) on GitHub and rename it to `<GH_USERNAME>.github.io`. Please note that the default branch code is in development.  If you want the site to be stable, please switch to the [latest tag][latest-tag] and start writing.
